	<h1> Help with Chain Challenges </h1>
	OK, I just completed Lunatic CC Ch. 5 and 6. So after doing some trial and error with the lower Hard difficulties, I think these are some of the mistakes you're making:
<b> <p> 1. You're not using your archers: </b>
<p id= "para1">Valentine Roy and Brave Lyn absolutely kill this CC, especially if they have a Brave Bow or Brave Bow + equipped. A lot of the enemies here, like the 
Whitewings, Subaki and Hinoka, do not have Iote's Shield skill or seal equipped, so the archers easily kill them. A Brave Bow also lets you charge your specials fast, so you 
can kill the high DEF armored enemies as well. The bow users also can attack over thin walls. That enabled me to kill Minerva on Stage 2 before she could Lunge me to death.

<b> <p> 2. Your seal selection is too thin: </b>
<p class= "paraClass1 paraClass2">  I notice you do not have Distant/Close Defense or the Atk Ploy seals. These seals can be created in the Sacred Seal forge. 
They are very helpful for long challenges like this. If you don't have enough coins or badges to create them, then you need to spend more time first in Arena Assault and 
Training Tower until you get enough resources. Once you do, equip DD/CD seal on your heavy hitters and AP on your healer (that allows healer to debuff, as well as heal).
